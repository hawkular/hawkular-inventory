# here we go... our mighty sed filter explained:
# -n flag: print nothing unless specifically instructed to by the sed script
#
# s/^\\[INFO\\] org\\.apache\\.maven\\.cli\\.event\\.ExecutionEventLogger - \\( *[^ ].*\\)$/[INFO] \\1/p;
# print all [INFO] lines of the main Maven CLI logger (if there is any non-space after [INFO]). This is used to make sure that we see what is currently being built.
#
# /WARN/p;
# print any line that has "WARN" in it.
#
# /ERROR/p
# print any line that has "ERROR" in it.
#
# /^Tests run/p
# print the summary of the test results
#
# /^.* <<< FAILURE! *$/p
# This how surefire reports errors, so we output that to have some visibility of the failing tests in the travis log.
#
# /.* <<< ERROR! */,/^\s*$/p
# If there is a test error print it and everything under it until the next empty line - this way we see the failed tests.
#
# With this, we have the overview of what stage the build is currently in, yet we don't flood the output with stuff from tests and merely informative messages from the build.
