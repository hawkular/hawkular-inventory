= Hawkular Inventory Load Tests

A simple load testing tool for Hawkular Inventory

== Why a Maven project?

Because it makes it easier for developers to fire a load test:
there's no need to download, extract and configure PATH.

== The scenario

The simulation creates `n` resource types (configurable by `-DresourceTypes=n`) and for each resource type `m` metric types (`-DmetricTypes=m`).
It creates the entities and also associates them together.

See the scenario file for the list of options.

== Running

    ./mvnw gatling:execute -Dxxx=y ...

Each scenario option can be set with a system property.

The scenario assumes a Hawkular server is running somewhere and does not start one.
By default, it tries to connect to `http://localhost:8080`.
