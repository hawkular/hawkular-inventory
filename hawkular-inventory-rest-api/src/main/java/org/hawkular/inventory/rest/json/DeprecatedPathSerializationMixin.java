/**
 * We need to deserialize paths manually in REST API, because we cannot provide the default
 * {@link DetypedPathDeserializer} with enough info in the early stages of request processing.
 *
 * <p>So we need to configure it with a custom mixin that will be used just for serialization. Note that the paths
 * are serialized <b>WITH</b> the tenant ID included, even though REST API can accept paths WITHOUT a tenant ID and
 * automagically modify the paths to include the current tenant ID in them. This is so that the clients that use the
 * paths obtained from the inventory server can use them as opaque identifiers without any requirements on processing
 * them before passing them along further. The paths obtained from inventory are the "true" stuff, but inventory is
 * kind enough to let the clients produce simpler, tenant-less, paths when talking to it.
