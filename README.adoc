= Hawkular Inventory

toc::[]

This is the inventory module for Hawkular - basically "the registry" of stuff in Hawkular.

Hawkular is a modular systems monitoring suite, that consists of several sub-projects for
storing of metrics, alerting on incoming events and more. Those projects are developed
in their own GitHub repositories and integrated in this project.

== About Inventory

Inventory stores "entities" and relationships between them. There are several types of entities that the inventory
understands and a handful of predefined relationship types. While one cannot declare a new type of entity, one can
create arbitrary relationships between the entities, not just the predefined ones.

== Structure

The project is divided into several modules

* api: the Java API of Hawkular Inventory
* impl-tinkerpop: the default implementation of the API on top of http://www.tinkerpop.com[Tinkerpop]
https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki[Gremlin] 2.6.0.
* rest-servlet: A JAX-RS servlet implementation that provides a gateway to the Java API. It creates a .war file that
contain the Java API and implementation to be deployed into a WildFly server.
* rest-test: Integration tests of the rest-api above

== Setup

=== Library

You can either use the inventory as a library - just depend on the `api` module and have the `impl-tinkerpop` module on
you class path. You can then start using the inventory by calling:
```java
Inventory inventory = InventoryFactory.newInstance();
Configuration cfg = Configuration.builder()....build();

inventory.initialize(cfg);

//off you go
```

=== Web Application

The `rest-servlet` module builds a web application archive `WAR` which is by out-of-the-box deployable to a
http://wildfly.org[Wildfly] server. Additional libraries might be required on the classpath if deployed into other
containers (please inspect the `pom.xml` file for the dependencies).

Once deployed to the Wildfly server, the application by default uses an in-memory graph database that is persisted to
a file on the default location of `$WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/data/hawkular-inventory`.

The web application passes all system properties as the configuration of the inventory and hence it is possible to use
the system properties to override those defaults. See the <<Configuration>> chapter for details.

=== Configuration

It is possible to use other graph database that supports the Tinkerpop Blueprints API by providing the necessary
implementation configuration (i.e. use the `Configuration.Builder.withConfiguration()` method or
`Configuration.Builder.addConfigurationProperty()` method. E.g. for the tinkerpop implementation of the inventory
(well, there is no other ATM ;) ) use the `blueprints.graph` property to set the graph implementation class to use and
other properties that are specific to the chosen implementation to configure it. The supplied implementation must
support the `TransactionalGraph` interface.

== Description of the API

=== Package `org.hawkular.inventory.api`

Contains the interfaces that comprise the API + the entity and filtering classes. The API is not tied in any form to the
underlying storage mechanism but expresses the graph nature of the inventory. The main idea of the API is that it

* is highly regular
* needs to express the "walk" through the inventory graph easily.

There are therefore 2 kinds of interfaces:

* ones that express the common operations on various entities (expressed by the generic `ReadInterface`,
`WriteInterface` and `RelateInterface`),
* ones that define the possible next steps on walk, divided into so-called `Single` or `Multiple` interfaces (specific
to each type of the entity) that support traversing from a single entity or from multiple entities respectively.

There is a bunch of final uninstantiable classes in this package with names in the plural of the various entity types.
These "wrap" the definition of the traversal and operation interfaces for given type of entity. I.e. the `Environments`
class defines the traversal interfaces `Environments.Single` and `Environments.Multiple` and the operation interfaces
`Environments.Read`, `Environments.ReadWrite` and `Environments.ReadRelate` as its inner classes.

This pattern is followed for all the other entity types.

While the interfaces might look a bit impenetrable and hard to follow, they provide for a (IMHO) very nice flow when
composing a traversal through the inventory, which can be illustrated by the following example:

```java
Set<Metric> metrics = inventory.tenants().get("com.acme.tenant").environments().get("production").resources()
   .get("host").metrics().getAll(Related.asTargetWith(metricDefinition, Relationships.Wellknown.defines)).entities();
```

This will find all the metrics with the type defined by the metricDefinition which are associated with the "host"
resource in the "production" environment of the "com.acme.tenant" tenant.

=== Package `org.hawkular.inventory.api.model`

Contains the POJOs for various entities understood by the inventory. The POJO entity classes are immutable but should be
JAXB-friendly. Some of the classes define a `Blueprint` inner class. Such blueprint classes are used when creating
an entity. You generally don't need to provide all the data that the entity requires because some of it can be deduced
from the position in the traversal of the graph from where the `create` method is being called.

=== Package `org.hawkular.inventory.filters`

There is a finite set of possible filter types which are captured by the various classes in this package. The base class
is surprisingly called `Filter` and is basically only a marker class (with some builder-like facilities but no actual
filtering definitions possible). Other classes express the filtering by various relations in the inventory (with 1
generic relationship filter - `Related`) or filtering by id or type - the `With` class and its inner classes.

The idea of these filters is that the implementations of the API are not forced to provide some generic filtering
mechanism but are only required to provide support for this small set of predefined filter types.

== Logger

Hawkular-Inv uses Logger prefix `HAWKINV` for logging with JBoss-Logging.

Code ranges are
api: 1-999
impl-tinkerpop:  1000-1999
rest-api : 2000-2999

== Rest Tests

The rest-tests are not run by default as they need a running WildFly server with `rest-servlet` web application
deployed. To run them manually you can specify not to skip them

    ./mvnw -Dmaven.test.skip=false test
