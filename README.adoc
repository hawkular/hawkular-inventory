= Hawkular-Inventory

Hawkular-Inventory is the Inventory module for Hawkular - basically "The Registry" of
stuff in Hawkular.

Hawkular is a modular systems monitoring suite, that consists of several sub-projects for
storing of metrics, alerting on incoming events and more. Those projects are developed
in their own GitHub repositories and integrated in this project.

== About Inventory

The project is divided into several modules

* api: the Java Api of Hawkular-Inventory
* impl: the Backend implementation of the Inventory service
* rest-servlet: A JAX-RS servlet implementation that provides a gateway to the Java Api. It creates a .war file that
contain the Java api and Implementation to be deployed into a WildFly server
* rest-test: Integration tests of the rest-api above

== Setup

The build currently runs inside a WildFly server, that has a H2-DB installed. You can use the following
snippet to configure this database:

[source,xml]
----
<datasource jta="true" jndi-name="java:/jdbc/HawkularDS" pool-name="HawkularDS" enabled="true" use-ccm="true">
    <connection-url>jdbc:h2:standalone/data/hawkular_db</connection-url>
    <driver-class>org.h2.Driver</driver-class>
    <driver>h2</driver>
    <security>
        <user-name>sa</user-name>
        <password>sa</password>
    </security>
    <validation>
        <validate-on-match>false</validate-on-match>
        <background-validation>false</background-validation>
    </validation>
    <timeout>
        <set-tx-query-timeout>false</set-tx-query-timeout>
        <blocking-timeout-millis>0</blocking-timeout-millis>
        <idle-timeout-minutes>0</idle-timeout-minutes>
        <query-timeout>0</query-timeout>
        <use-try-lock>0</use-try-lock>
        <allocation-retry>0</allocation-retry>
        <allocation-retry-wait-millis>0</allocation-retry-wait-millis>
    </timeout>
    <statement>
        <share-prepared-statements>false</share-prepared-statements>
    </statement>
</datasource>
----

The datasource files will then be created inside the `standalone/data/` directory:

----
wildfly-8.2.0.Final $ ls standalone/data/
content  hawkular_db.h2.db  timer-service-data  tx-object-store
----

To clean the database, just remove those `hawkular_db.h2*` files.

We will make some automated process available in the future.
