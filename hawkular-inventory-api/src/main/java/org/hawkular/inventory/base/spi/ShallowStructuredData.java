 *
 * <p>When calling {@link InventoryBackend#convert(Discriminator, Object, Class)}, with {@link StructuredData}, the whole structured
 * data is loaded. On the other hand calling it with {@code ShallowStructuredData} will make the convert method not load
 * the potential children of the structured data.
